I’m delighted to share that I have recently started my Project Internship at Cybernaut Edtech, beginning on October 16th, 2025, and continuing through January 16th, 2026.

This internship marks an important step in my Data Science journey, where I’ll be gaining hands-on experience across multiple domains through structured learning modules.

Internship Modules:
📘 Month 1 – Web Scraping
📗 Month 2 – Machine Learning
📙 Month 3 – Flask and Django

I’ve started working on my first project titled —
💻 “CryptoPlus Trend Analysis using Flask and Matplotlib Mini Dashboard”

✅In this project, I’m building a real-time cryptocurrency price tracker and trend analyzer that:
Scrapes live cryptocurrency data using BeautifulSoup and Selenium
✅ Cleans, processes, and visualizes data using Pandas and Matplotlib
✅ Displays interactive charts and insights through a Flask-based web interface

This project has helped me explore both data visualization and backend integration, strengthening my analytical and programming skills.

I’m truly thankful to Cybernaut Edtech for this incredible opportunity to learn, innovate, and grow under their guidance. Excited for the upcoming modules and more challenging projects ahead! 🚀
